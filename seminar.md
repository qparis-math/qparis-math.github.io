## On the interactions between Statistics and Geometry
![A.D.Alexandrov following the gradient](/images/Alexandrov.png "A.D.Alexandrov following the gradient"){: .align-right width="220px"}
Starting from January 2024, this monthly online seminar invites researchers working in Geometry or Mathematical Statistics to present a paper, result or idea. The aim is to promote communication between the two fields. We encourage speakers to give synthetic and pedagogical talks of about one hour, aimed at a broad mathematical audience. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): 
- Statistics and Learning in metric spaces,
- Non-Euclidean Optimization and Sampling,
- Optimal Transport,
- Information Geometry,
- Manifold Learning,
- Functional Inequalities. 

The seminar is co-organised by  [Victor-Emmanuel Brunel](https://vebrunel.fr), [Austin Stomme](https://austinjstromme.github.io), [Alexey Kroshnin](https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/219293044) and [Quentin Paris](https://qparis-math.github.io).

## Next talk
> ### January 19, 2024
> - **Speaker**: [Eugene Stepanov](https://cvgmt.sns.it/person/26/) (PDMI RAS, Universita di Pisa, HSE University)
> - **Title**: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of squared distance matrices and geometry of metric measure spaces
> - **Abstract**: We will discuss what the spectral data of matrices of squared distances  between points from very large subsets (covering densely the space in the limit) of a metric measure space say about the geometry of the latter. In particular, we will discuss how the metric measure space can be reconstructed from such data.
