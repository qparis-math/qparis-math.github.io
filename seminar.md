Starting from January 2024, this monthly online seminar invites researchers working in Geometry or Mathematical Statistics to present a paper, result or idea. The aim is to promote communication between the two fields. We encourage speakers to give synthetic and pedagogical talks of about one hour, aimed at a broad mathematical audience. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): 
- Statistics and Learning in metric spaces,
- Non-Euclidean Optimization and Sampling,
- Optimal Transport,
- Information Geometry,
- Manifold Learning,
- Functional Inequalities. 

The seminar is co-organised by  [Victor-Emmanuel Brunel](https://vebrunel.fr), [Austin Stomme](https://austinjstromme.github.io), [Alexey Kroshnin](https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/219293044) and [Quentin Paris](https://qparis-math.github.io).
