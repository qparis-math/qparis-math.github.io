Since 2020, I am Associate Professor at the [Computer Science Faculty](https://cs.hse.ru/en/) of [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/) in Moscow. I have been Assistant Professor at HSE University from 2014 to 2020. From 2013 to 2014 I held a Postdoctoral position at the Statistics Department at [CREST](https://crest.science/research/research-fields/statistics/?ul_filter_wp_capabilities=people_faculty). I obtained my PhD in 2013 at [ENS Rennes](https://www.ens-rennes.fr)  under the supervision of [Benoit Cadre](https://w3.ens-rennes.fr/math/people/benoit.cadre/](https://perso.univ-rennes2.fr/benoit.cadre) and [Bruno Pelletier](http://pelletierb.perso.math.cnrs.fr/index.html).

I work at the intersection of Statistics, Machine Learning and Geometry. My current research looks at ways Geometry informs the performance of Statistical Learning algorithms.
